This repository contains the code, data, and analysis pipelines for the paper "Data-driven modeling and classification of brain blood-flow pathologies."

We propose a sparse, interpretable model of cerebral blood-flow dynamics using SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), and evaluate its effectiveness in classifying pathologies (Intracranial arterial aneurysms (AA), arteriovenous malformations (AVM)) by model parameters.

In this repository, you will find jupyter-notebooks to learn the proposed model from the experimental pressure and velocity data.
